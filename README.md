### Hi I'm Alex! Here's a little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Aurum](https://github.com/alex0112/aurum)! (An API Wrapper for Coinbase in *Elixir*)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about [Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming) by working through [this fantastic book](https://pragprog.com/titles/smgaelixir/genetic-algorithms-in-elixir/).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: `alarsen0112 at gmail dot com`
- ðŸ“• Currently reading: [Amusing Ourselves to Death](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74034.Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death) by Neil Postman, among other things.
- I have a ~~bad~~ *great* habit of replacing `for` loops with `map/filter/reduce` implementations.
